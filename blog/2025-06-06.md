# New GitHub Pages Community Key

![](images/2025-06-06.png){.rounded-lg}

All projects should have access to professional-grade documentation, no matter their budget. Starting today, the **Retype Pro Community Key** for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) brings Retypeâ€™s full feature set to any project published on GitHub Pages, **at no cost and with no strings attached**.

### Community Key

```

You can add the above [[community]] key to your [Retype Wallet](/guides/cli.md#retype-wallet) using the `retype wallet --add <key>` command. The command below includes the full `<key>` making it easy to copy/paste:

```
